# Housing Classification
This exercise comes from Chapter 2, out of "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow."
- The goal is to predict median housing price in a given district. 

## Models
- The first model implemented was a Linear Regression model, but there was room for a performance increase.
- Next was to implement a Decision Tree Regressor since the data wasn't very linear. It performed well, but still there was room for growth.
- The last model was a Random Tree Regressor. Coincidentally being the most powerful of the three models, it performed the best.
